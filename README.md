# SemiotNet Stablecoin Streaming Network (sTT)
- VDF Powered Time Lock Weighted Average based Stationary Stablecoin Streaming Network

## Introduction

Stablility of Money and Money Markets is quite closely connected with the circulation in the dimensions of time and space. Most of the cases we measure money markets in a geographic and demographic distribution of markets alone. Time becomes a static and independent variable most of the time. Our unique approach is to parameterise time dimension in a coinage. We are constructing cryptographically powered time locks for averaging stablecoin supply and demand agnositc to the networ effects of money markets. 

Hence Semiott Secure Stablecoin is Algorithmic Stablecoin providing users the advantages of Blockchain through privacy in transactions while at the time same protecting users from high volatility. SemiotNet works with a set of two supply side dynamics â€“ expansion and contraction. If the price of the coin rises, automatically more coins are issue to increase the supply and reduce the price. The same goes for price reduction wherein supply is contracted digitally to increase the price back to equilibrium. The user always holds the same percentage of Stablecoins from the universe throughout such expansion and contraction phases, hence protecting the user from a significant amount of market risk. 

SemiotNet has a twofold perspective towards the deployment of an Algorithmic Stablecoin. Stemming from the guarantee of privacy, it provides more amateur users to experiment with the world of cryptocurrencies before moving into more volatile currencies. Secondly it ensures the primary usage of a Stablecoin as a means to an end in the financial system by serving as a tender towards making payments through an official system. Stablecoins have grown over 493% over 2020 and the road ahead is only steeper. SemiotNet is a strong and balanced entry into this world of Stablecoins guaranteeing the fiat value of currency along with the privacy which is held most dearest in this digital age.
